## About

- I am Raunak Rana, a versatile professional with expertise as a Full Stack Developer and a strong foundation in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). In addition to building scalable and responsive applications, I bring significant experience in blockchain development, smart contract auditing, and Web3 technologies, enabling me to deliver secure and efficient technical solutions.

My career journey also highlights my proficiency in marketing and sales, where I contributed to creating impactful campaigns targeting Web3 and crypto communities. From analyzing trends and user behavior to developing engaging content and optimizing campaign strategies, I have successfully bridged the gap between technical innovation and user engagement.

Currently, as a Smart Contract Auditor, I collaborate with global security experts to enhance the reliability of DeFi projects, while my diverse experience allows me to contribute holistically to projects at the intersection of technology and marketing..
